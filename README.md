This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s a fun and interactive way to play the classic hand game directly in your browser.

The rules are simple:

You choose either Rock, Paper, or Scissors by clicking a button.

The computer randomly selects its choice.

The winner is decided based on the traditional rules:

Rock beats Scissors

Scissors beats Paper

Paper beats Rock

Same choices result in a tie

The game interface is styled with CSS for a clean and user-friendly look, while JavaScript handles the game logic, score tracking, and the computer’s random move generation.

This project is a great example of combining the three core web technologies to create an interactive application. It demonstrates:

HTML for structuring the buttons, text, and score display

CSS for styling the layout and making it visually appealing

JavaScript for implementing the game logic and interactivity

It’s a beginner-friendly project that helps in learning DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic JavaScript logic.
